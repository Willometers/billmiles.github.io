title: Embracing the blackbox
---

Rails, React, Redux... 

As more and more complexity is introduced to the module project requirements there is also more and more automation introduced. Looking back on the early days of the SE program there was toiling over scope, order-of-operations, and so much more within the smallest blocks of code. 

Now, however, huge swaths of data are pushed through abstraction and refactoring. For me the hardest part of transitioning from a street-level understanding of code to wielding masses of interwoven libraries was the lack of seeing, with absolute clarity, the connections between all aspects of the code. 

The way forward is to embrace the blackbox. For me, and I'm sure for many others, there is a strong desire to capture that "aha" moment where it all falls into place within your mind. But in reality it's more of a slow thawing to trusting the libraries and the folks behind those libraries that things will work even if you can't intelligbly describe how or why. In the same way one can learn to drive a car or bake a cake from a recipe; one must let go a little but, and trust the process (and be willing to debug and debug and debug...).
